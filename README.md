# Lattice-Boltzmann-Method_Flow-around-Cylinder

The Lattice Boltzmann Method which is based on the Lattice Gas Automata, is one of the CFD methods to solve a fluid dynamics problem. It is highly parallelizable method and can be used for problems with complex boundaries.

Here we analyze the flow around a Cylinder using the LBM implemented in Python.
